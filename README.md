## 🚩 Project overview

**AnyGrab** is a Python utility that continuously **monitors AnyDesk connections** on your system and displays **remote IP addresses and ports** in a beautiful **gradient CLI interface**. It includes a **persistent blacklist** to avoid duplicate entries and supports **console transparency** for a sleek look.

## ✨ Features

* 👀 **Monitor AnyDesk Connections** — Detect running AnyDesk processes and log their active connections.
* 🧠 **Persistent Blacklist** — Avoid duplicate IP addresses by storing them in a persistent blacklist.
* 🌈 **Gradient CLI Interface** — Uses `rgbprint` for beautiful color gradients and scrolling messages.
* 🖥️ **Console Transparency** — Adjustable transparency for a modern and aesthetic CLI.
* ⚡ **Real-time Monitoring** — Continuously checks AnyDesk connections and prints updates in real-time.

## 🧭 How It Works

1. Run the tool (`python main.py`).
2. The program **monitors AnyDesk processes** on your system.
3. When AnyDesk is detected, it **grabs active remote connections** and displays:
   * Remote IP
   * Port
4. The program **ignores local-link addresses** (`169.254.x.x`) and common ports like 80 and 443.
5. **Duplicate IPs are blacklisted** automatically to avoid repeated notifications.
6. The CLI displays messages in **color gradients** and scroll animations for a premium visual experience.

## 🧰 Requirements

* 🐍 Python **3.9+**
* 📦 Dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install rgbprint psutil colorama
    ```

* 🖥️ Windows operating system (for console transparency and netstat)

## ⚙️ Technical Details

* Uses `psutil` to detect running AnyDesk processes.
* Uses `subprocess` with `netstat` to capture TCP connections.
* Filters out **LISTENING** ports and local-link addresses.
* Console transparency is implemented via `ctypes` and Windows API.
* Gradient and scrolling effects are handled via the `rgbprint` library.
* Persistent blacklist ensures each IP is printed only once.
